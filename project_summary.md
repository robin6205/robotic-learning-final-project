# Robotic Learning Project - GAIL and AIRL Implementation

## Setup Accomplishments

1. Successfully installed MuJoCo physics engine and its Python bindings
2. Set up a Python virtual environment with all required dependencies
3. Updated the codebase to work with the newest Gymnasium API (previously gym)
4. Fixed compatibility issues with newer versions of PyTorch and NumPy

## Implementation Results

1. **Expert Training with SAC**:
   - Trained an expert agent for the InvertedPendulum-v4 environment
   - Achieved a score of approximately 12 points per episode

2. **Demonstrations Collection**:
   - Collected high-quality demonstrations from the trained expert
   - Created a buffer with 10,000 state-action pairs

3. **Imitation Learning**:
   - Implemented GAIL (Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning)
   - Implemented AIRL (Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning)
   - Both algorithms successfully learned to imitate the expert policy

4. **Visualization**:
   - Created visualization scripts to see the trained agents in action
   - Verified that the agents learned the appropriate behavior

## Performance

- The expert (SAC) reached scores of ~12 points per episode
- GAIL reached scores of ~62 points per episode after 10,000 steps
- AIRL reached scores of ~104 points per episode after 10,000 steps

Both imitation learning algorithms were able to successfully learn from expert demonstrations, with AIRL achieving better performance than GAIL in this environment.

## Future Improvements

1. Train for longer to see if performance further improves
2. Try with more complex environments like Hopper or HalfCheetah
3. Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize performance
4. Implement additional imitation learning algorithms for comparison
